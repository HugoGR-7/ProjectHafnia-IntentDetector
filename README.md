This project explores the detection of human intent to prevent vehicle theft before it happens. Using the VLM API, video footage of different behaviors around parked cars is analyzed — some showing normal activity, others showing potential theft attempts.

The model then estimates the person’s intent and, in a real-world deployment, could trigger early alerts to security guards or police.

Different prompts and video intentions were used. For the final presentation for the Hackathon, only the "walking by" was used
